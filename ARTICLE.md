[Write Code That Is Easy to Delete, Not Easy to Extend](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)

I like this article because it makes programming feel a little less intimidating and a lot more honest. As a computer science major who doesn't really enjoy coding, I appreciate how it admits that most code isn't perfect, and that it's okay to write things that might be thrown away later. The idea of writing code that's easy to delete instead of obsessing over making it reusable or perfect makes sense to me, because it focuses on it being just practical and sort of resuable rather than something perfect I have to spend an excessive amount of time on. It reminds me that software development is more about managing change and mistakes than about flawless execution, which makes the whole process feel more managable and not something that has to completely invade my life.
